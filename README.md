# -LOAN-ELIGIBILITY-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-



>The accessibility and availability of huge amounts of data will be
able to provide us useful knowledge if certain data mining techniques
are applied on it. The main goal is to determine new patterns and then
to interpret these patterns to deliver significant and useful information
for the users. Since the number of parameters involved in predicting
loan approval are vast and they have complex interdependence, machine learning is an appropriate tool to tackle the challenge of loan
approval prediction. We implement various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive
Bayes, Neural Networks etc.., and measure their performance in prediction. We also attempt to combine the classifiers using a Meta Classifier to produce greater predictive capability.
